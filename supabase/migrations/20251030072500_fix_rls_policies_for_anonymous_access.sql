  # Fix RLS Policies for Anonymous Access

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing RLS policies that rely on JWT claims
    - Create new policies that allow anonymous access based on token matching
    - Simplify access control for polls, proposals, and votes
  
  2. Security Notes
    - Polls are accessible via admin_token or vote_token in query
    - Voters identified by client-generated voter_id stored in localStorage
    - One vote per voter per poll enforced by unique constraint
